PfSaaS is PC from Scratch in the cloud!

Supply a program of maximum size of 512 integers and it will run at address 0.

We have alot of customers, so make sure the code runs in less than 30 seconds.

Our infrastructure uses post-quantum blockchain AI monitoring, so there is no way you'll ever be able to read sensitive information!

Note: You need to use the `documentation.md` and `emulator.sb3` from the first part.
