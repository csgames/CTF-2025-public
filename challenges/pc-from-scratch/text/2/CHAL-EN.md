I use a Really Secure Algorithm to store my passwords. The `output` file is the encryption of a very special input (the flag). Can you decrypt it?

Don't get overwhelmed by the code, take one *little* bite at a time.

Note: You need to use the `documentation.md` and `emulator.sb3` from the first part.
