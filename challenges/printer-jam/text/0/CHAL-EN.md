Hi, I'm Mark! You must be the IT team? Workers at our abroad facility are complaining of having issues with their ZEROZ brick printer. It's been a week since the last print, we're losing good customers due to this... They're saying that the bricks keep getting stuck at the top of the *stack*. Can you connect to the printer and see what's up?

If it can help, ZEROZ sent us the source code of their printer because we are a valuable customer of their's. You can find it in `source.zip`. Make sure to not take it out with you when you leave because it's under very strict NDA.
