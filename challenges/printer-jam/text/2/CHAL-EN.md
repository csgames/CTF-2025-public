Sorry for bothering you while you're working, but the situation got worst... The printer is now non-stop beeping. They tried unplugging it but due to the ZEROZ patented battery, the printer won't turn off for days...

We use to be able to fix this through the `admin` menu but it was disabled due to `CVE-1994-6634`. ZEROZ promised they would send out a patch soon but they haven't. I'm sure the feature still exists; maybe there's another way to jump into it?
